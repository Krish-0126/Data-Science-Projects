#**Audio classification using deep learning**#

This is my project on **Audio classification using deep learning**. 
In this project I have used ANN to clasify the audio from 10 categories.


**Dataset info** - This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, 
children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, engine_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are 
drawn from the urban sound taxonomy described in the following article, which also includes a detailed description of 
the dataset and how it was compiled:

J. Salamon, C. Jacoby and J. P. Bello, "A Dataset and Taxonomy for Urban Sound Research", 
22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, Orlando USA, Nov. 2014.

All excerpts are taken from field recordings uploaded to www.freesound.org. The files are pre-sorted into ten folds
(folders named fold1-fold10) to help in the reproduction of and comparison with the automatic classification results
reported in the article above.
The class of data present in the dataset are :- 
0 = air_conditioner
1 = car_horn
2 = children_playing
3 = dog_bark
4 = drilling
5 = engine_idling
6 = gun_shot
7 = jackhammer
8 = siren
9 = street_music
